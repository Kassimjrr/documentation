# Inviting team members

You can invite members to your workspace to create forms and view submission as a team.

When you invite team members to join your Formspark workspace, they will receive a confirmation email.

:::tip
You can send invitations to users who still need to create a Formspark account or to those who already have one.

## Steps

1. Open the `Members` screen
2. Fill the form and press `Send`

## Roles

A workspace member is either an _admin_ or a _member_.

Workspace _admins_ are superusers who can:

- Change the role of a workspace member.
- Remove a member from the workspace.
- Delete the workspace.
