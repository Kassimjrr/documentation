# Webhooks

Formspark can send webhook events that notify your application any time you receive a form submission.

## Setup

1. Define an endpoint on your server for receiving events, this route should listen for `POST` events and return a `200` status code.
2. Paste the endpoint into the `Webhook URL` field found in your form's settings.
3. Submit to your form and verify your endpoint is receiving submissions successfully.

## Payload format

Given the following form:

```html
<form action="https://submit-form.com/your-form-id">
  <input type="text" name="email" />
  <textarea name="description" />
  <button type="submit">Send</button>
</form>
```

The body of the POST request will looks as follows:

```json
{
  "email": "kramer@nineties.sitcom",
  "message": "Who turns down a Junior Mint?"
}
```

## Testing and troubleshooting

- Your endpoint should accept POST requests.
- Your endpoint should be able to parse a JSON object.
- Your endpoint's url length should not exceed 512 characters.
- You can use a service such as [requestcatcher.com](https://requestcatcher.com) to test the integration with your form.

## Removal

To stop using webhooks, clear the `Webhook URL` field found in your form's settings.
