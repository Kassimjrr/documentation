# Common issues

## My submissions are not showing up

- Ensure all input, select and textarea elements inside your form have a `name` attribute, otherwise you will not
  receive the data filled in these fields.
- Keep in mind that empty submissions are ignored by Formspark.
- Are you using some form of spam protection? Temporarily disable the protection, if you are able to submit without it
  then you probably need to double-check your integration.
  Step-by-step instructions can be found [here](/setup/spam-protection).

## I cannot find my forms

1. Ensure that you are signed in with the correct email address.
2. Ensure that you are connected to the right workspace: [View My Workspaces](https://dashboard.formspark.io/workspaces)
   .
